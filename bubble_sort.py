#Received message. An algorithm is a set of steps or rules that can be followed to solve a problem or achieve a goal. There are many different algorithms for different kinds of problems, such as sorting, searching, or encryption. Here is an example of an algorithm that sorts a list of numbers using the bubble sort method: ```python # Define a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a sorted list def bubble_sort(numbers): # Repeat until the list is sorted while True: # Assume the list is sorted sorted = True # Loop through the list and compare adjacent elements for i in range(len(numbers) - 1): # If the current element is larger than the next one, swap them if numbers[i] > numbers[i + 1]: # Swap the elements using a temporary variable temp = numbers[i] numbers[i] = numbers[i + 1] numbers[i + 1] = temp # Set the sorted flag to False sorted = False # If the list is sorted, break out of the loop if sorted: break # Return the sorted list return numbers # Test the function with an example list numbers = [5, 3, 8, 2, 9, 1] print("Unsorted list:", numbers) numbers = bubble_sort(numbers) print("Sorted list:", numbers) ```
